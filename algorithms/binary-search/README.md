# Binary Search

## Description

Binary search is an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time O(log n).

It takes a sorted list as input and the item that you are looking for. It then will take that sorted list, look at the middle value and compare it to the item that you are searching for. If the guess is too low then it will ignore everything with a lower value and repeat, if the guess is too high then it will ignore everything with a higher value and repeat.
