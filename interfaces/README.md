# Interfaces

## Description

Selection of investigations into interfaces

Interfaces within Go allows you to have polymorphism with different types. Can also be called substitutability.

Polymorphism is the ability to write code that can take on different behaviour through the implementation of types. Once a type implements an interface, an entire world of functionality can be opened up to the values of that type. - Bill Kennedy
